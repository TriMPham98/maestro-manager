# Next Steps for Maestro Manager

## Current Implementation

We've built a comprehensive structure for the Maestro Manager CRM with the following features:

1. **Landing Page**: A professional landing page that explains the benefits of the CRM for music teachers.
2. **Dashboard**: An overview page showing key metrics and upcoming lessons.
3. **Student Management**: A page to view, search, and manage students.
4. **Lesson Scheduling**: A calendar view for scheduling and managing lessons.
5. **Payment Tracking**: A page to track and manage payments.
6. **Settings**: Pages to configure user profile and application preferences.
7. **Database Schema**: A complete Prisma schema for all entities (users, students, lessons, payments, etc.).
8. **API Routes**: RESTful API endpoints for students, lessons, and payments.
9. **Authentication**: User registration and login with NextAuth.js.

## What's Working

- **Database Schema**: The Prisma schema is complete and ready to use.
- **API Routes**: Basic CRUD operations for students, lessons, and payments.
